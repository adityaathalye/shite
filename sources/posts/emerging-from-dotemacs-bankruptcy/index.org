My extant Emacs configuration is built with the handy and battle tested [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][prelude]]
starter kit, created by indomitable Emacs fanatic and gentleman hacker, [[https://metaredux.com/about/][bbatsov]],
a.k.a. "Bug", a.k.a. Bozhidar Batsov.

The smart move would be to stick with /prelude/ and fix /my/ gunk instead. However,
for better or worse, it is /that time/ in my developer life-cycle. The irrational
gnawing urge to take it apart and rebuild it in my own image has overpowered my
standard clawing reluctance to fix what ain't broke.

To be honest, it has been /that time/ for a good while now. Like, years? As it
happens, I had to face facts when I got serious about overhauling my Emacs config.
My Emacs 26 was three major versions behind. But underneath lurked my OS, at the
fag end of its LTS support window. So /of course/, the OS /had/ to be upgraded
first. Two major LTS version upgrades later I had to let it rest. Then I fell
into writing my [[https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite][site-maker]], because otherwise how would I blog about reduxing
my dotemacs?

Meanwhile, desire to actually redux my config waned.

Now it waxes eloquent.

Plus, I am in-batch at [[https://www.recurse.com/][the Recurse Center]], as I type this.
It is a place where Yak Shaving for Joy is revered as a noble pursuit. As is
proper form.

Because it is our second coming, we already know we want a few things, listed
below, in no particular order.
- Clutter-free GUI
- Easy, fast, RSI-free navigation and movement (chording, completions)
- Quick, easy GUI organisation (split/move/switch/resize windows)
- Awesome completions everywhere (helm and/or ivy)
- Good undo/redo support (undo-tree)
- Expansions and boilerplate templates (Yasnippet)
- Org mode stuff (org-babel, present, export backends etc.)
- Version Control (magit)
- Polyglot Programming Language Support
  - LSP everywhere as far as possible
  - Clojure, MIT Scheme, Common Lisp, Bash, SQL, OCaml, APL, Java, JS, HTML, CSS, XML, YAML at least
  - Repo-wide refactorings
  - Structural code editing
  - Code folding
  - Code navigation (jump-to-definition etc.)
  - Auto linting
  - Auto formatting
  - Auto builds where applicable
  - Top notch remote REPL support (Clojure, Scheme etc.)
  - Multiple cursors
- Diagramming
- Various creature comforts
  - Nice theme, icons, typography
  - Font resizes for coding, demos, presentations
  - Auto save / restore files
  - Auto save / restore workspace
  - Recent files memory
  - ...
- Maybe other use cases I don't currently employ too much
  - Email
  - PDF reading
  - Web browsing
- etc...

Last but not least, a bankruptcy emergence requires a bankruptcy filing. The
filing is hereby filed. The game is afoot. And /prelude/ remains my spiritual guide.

Remember that the ultimate goal of every Emacs user is to create an Emacs setup
that reflects their own experience, needs, goals and ideas. Just like Lisp, Emacs
is nothing but a raw building material for the perfect editing experience.
