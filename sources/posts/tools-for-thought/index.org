At the risk of badly mangling things smarter people have probably already worked
out [fn:1] over seven plus decades and counting of the ongoing computer revolution [fn:2],
here goes.

* Category One: Memory Assistant

I'd box all the note taking tools in here---as persistent store and/or organiser
and/or search tools. As a user of such a tool, all meaning-making is the job of my
brain. I must work out the known unknowns, deal with the unknown unknowns when
they happen etc.

The tool functions like a mechanical memory + ontology + topology assist, which
helps me do a lot of thinking + learning /over long periods of time/ (like days,
weeks, years). Things like Ken Iverson's concept of /Notation as a Tool of Thought/ [fn:3]
would also fall into this category (filed under "methods to compress information
into symbols and mnemonics and transmit them").

Hell, why be so fancy? I dump it all into my haphazardly organised org files and
~rgrep~ and its going... fine?

* Category Two: Co-processor

Two intellects working together to arrive at a common model / picture / frame of
understanding. People on the Internet and in my familiar circle of gentlenerds
seem to be excited about CoPilot / ChatGPT etc. in this sense.

I can't help but see those as just more of /Category One/ type tools. Why?
Because co-processors must be capable of communicating understanding of abstract
models with each other (a kind of "Communicating with Aliens" [fn:4] problem).
AFAIK, none of these tools are capable of explaining /why/ they're doing what
they're doing.

The one exception I could concede to is machines that are excellent at /finite
games/. That too because odds are higher of being able to independently verify
the machine's meta descriptions, and the outcomes would be reasonably reproducible
(viz. "I did X, because of heuristic Y, and rules P, Q, R.").

* Category Three: Teacher

One intelligence absorbing greater truths discovered by (or previously absorbed
by) another intelligence. Where the other intelligence has the metacognition to
know what they know, and to direct the other intelligence to that level of
understanding. The magic of beings capable of transferring culture, stories,
Laplace transforms, rate reaction equations, rules of grammar, interpretation of
law etc. across minds, and generations.

I'm thinking tribes, coaches, mathematics circles, therapists, the Vulcan Science
Academy and so forth... the ability to conjure up and communicate /about/ concepts
like communicating with aliens.

AFAIK, only biology is capable of producing this category of tools of thought.

In this context, I'm fascinated by the work being done on Bioelectric Networks
by Michael Levin's group [fn:5]. Almost prosaically, in their work/world the
definition of intelligence is a /mechanical/ one. So much so that they are able
to model and then produce (though not control or guarantee) biological structures
capable of progressively more sophisticated kinds of intelligence in the mechanical
terms they describe.

Which makes me wonder...

Is there something like the Kardashev Scale [fn:6], but for levels/depths/spans
of Intelligence?

/Intelligence amplification/ (IA) refers to the effective use of Information
technology in augmenting human intelligence.

/[[http://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/][Tools for Thought]]/;
an "an exercise in retrospective futurism" by Howard Rheingold, who introduced
the idea as follows.
#+begin_quote
*Tools for Thought* is an exercise in retrospective futurism; that is, I wrote it
in the early 1980s, attempting to look at what the mid 1990s would be like. My
odyssey started when I discovered Xerox PARC and Doug Engelbart and realized that
all the journalists who had descended upon Silicon Valley were missing the real
story. Yes, the tales of teenagers inventing new industries in their garages were
good stories. But the idea of the personal computer did not spring full-blown
from the mind of Steve Jobs. Indeed, the idea that people could use computers to
amplify thought and communication, as tools for intellectual work and social
activity, was not an invention of the mainstream computer industry nor orthodox
computer science, nor even homebrew computerists. If it wasn't for people like
J.C.R. Licklider, Doug Engelbart, Bob Taylor, Alan Kay, it wouldn't have happened.
But their work was rooted in older, equally eccentric, equally visionary, work,
so I went back to piece together how Boole and Babbage and Turing and von Neumann
‚Äî especially von Neumann ‚Äî created the foundations that the later toolbuilders
stood upon to create the future we live in today. You can't understand where
mind-amplifying technology is going unless you understand where it came from.

The thesis of the present paper is that the advantages of executability and
universality found in programming languages can be effectively combined, in a
single coherent language, with the advantages offered by mathematical notation.

[fn:4] The notion that fell out of JCR Licklider's thinking on how might we make
an "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergalactic_Computer_Network][Intergalactic Computer Network]]".

#+begin_quote
Consider the situation in which several different centers are netted together,
each center being highly individualistic and having its own special language and
its own special way of doing things. Is it not desirable, or even necessary for
all the centers to agree upon some language or, at least, upon some conventions
for asking such questions as ‚ÄúWhat language do you speak?‚Äù At this extreme, the
problem is essentially the one discussed by science fiction writers: ‚Äúhow do you
get communications started among totally uncorrelated ‚Äúsapient‚Äù beings?‚Äù

We work at the intersection of developmental biology, computer science, and cognitive

biological, artificial, and hybrid systems; we use these insights to develop
