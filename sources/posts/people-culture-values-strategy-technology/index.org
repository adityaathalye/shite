#+summary: Technology is—and ought to be—the /byproduct/ of far more important, powerful, and deep-rooted aspects of organisations — including wholesale societies. The pandemic of technology-solutionism gleefully embraced and amplified by all and sundry makes me believe that people seem to have decided it's the other way around.

# SHITE_META

Here is a chain of causality that appeals to my sensibilities about the location of technology, in context of organisations. /"Technology solutionism"/ is the (apparently irressistible) urge to invert the chain of causality.

The premise...

 ---> People create culture.

 ------> Culture shapes values.

 ---------> Values inform strategy.

 ------------> Technology is Strategy actualised.

The implication...

| Worst case                                         | Best case                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| > Destructive technology results                   | > Constructive technology results                   |
| > from violent strategy                            | > from enlightened strategy                         |
| > borne of pathological values                     | > borne of generative values                        |
| > normalized by vile culture                       | > normalized by alive culture                       |
| > catalysed by fear-based /leadership/ (verb-form) | > catalysed by trust-based /leadership/ (verb-form) |
| > enabled by hapless bystanders                    | > co-created by highly engaged participants         |
| Unfortunately widespread, easily achieved.         | Fortunately achievable, though high-effort.         |
| Hallmark of negative performance.                  | Hallmark of elite performance.                      |

Wouldn't it be nice if the "Best case" happened most of the time?

Wouldn't you like to be the sort of leader who makes it happen? A person of
whom people genuinely say "/I did some of the best work of my life because of
their leadership./"? Isn't that what good leadership is all about?

I've had one or two of those in my life so far. Enough to /believe/.

Here's the thing, though.
- It requires a lot of /self/-work, but you can't go it alone.
- There are no roads, but there are landmarks, GPSes, and gyroscopes.
- There are no formulas, but there are stories, clues, and feedback loops.
- There are few such leaders, but there are many followers, and leadership is
  teachable. Anyone going on this quest will discover the surprising array of
  people who want to rally around to help them succeed. I know I would!

There are many places to look. Here's just one such bag full of some pretty
good clues.
- /Westrum's typology of organizational culture/ (table below), as [[https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture][presented here]]
  in context of Google's DORA research, but which is generally applicable to any
  team within any organisation, as well as to any org of any size in any industry.
- Dr. Ron Westrum in conversation with Gene Kim at the /Idealcast/, for aural
  accompaniment during the day's perambulations:
