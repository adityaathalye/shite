*/eval/apply [fn:1] is my credo/*. To */eval/* is to think culture over
strategy, humans over technology, systems over hacks, workflows over tools. To
*/apply/* is to Design by /subtraction/ [fn:2], engineer for simplicity, produce
output iteratively, ship continuously.

*/Learn generously is my favourite directive [fn:3]./* One stands on the shoulders
of giants. One has received much generosity. One benefits greatly from contributions
to the public commons. And so the /eval/apply/ credo joins the directive to /learn
generously/, in all that I [[./posts/index.html][think]], [[https://github.com/adityaathalye/clojure-by-example][teach]], [[https://confengine.com/user/aditya-athalye-1][speak]], [[https://inclojure.org/][organise]], [[https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=adityaathalye][share]], [[https://github.com/adityaathalye/][code]], and work on.

# - */Eval/*: Think culture over strategy, humans over technology,
#   systems over hacks, workflows over tools.

# - */Apply/*: Design by /subtraction/ [fn:2], engineer for simplicity,
#   produce output iteratively, ship continuously.

# * /eval/apply is my modus operandi/

[fn:1] Computing pioneer Alan Kay dubbed /eval/apply/ the
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/mes/manual/html_node/LISP-as-Maxwell_0027s-Equations-of-Software.html][Maxwellâ€™s Equations of Software]].
It is such a stunningly compact and fundamental descriptor of all of computing.
To me, the concept also embodies similarly powerful non-dualities; think/do,
diffuse/focus, abstract/concretise. Over time, it became my /way/.

[fn:2] /"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential.
The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."/ --- Bruce Lee

[fn:3]  /Learn generously/ is a "[[https://www.recurse.com/self-directives][self-directive]]"
coined by the gentlepeople at my favourite programmers' community,
the Recurse Center.
